# Get it started.

In this chapter we are going to talk about the most common task: purchase of a product using [Paypal Pro Checkout](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro).
We assume you already read [get it started](https://github.com/Payum/Core/blob/master/Resources/docs/get-it-started.md) from core.
Here we just show you modifications you have to put to the files shown there.

## Installation

The preferred way to install the library is using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
Run composer require to add dependencies to _composer.json_:

```bash
php composer.phar require "payum/paypal-pro-checkout-nvp"
```

## config.php

We have to only add the gateway factory. All the rest remain the same:


```php
<?php
//config.php

// ...

$factory = new \Payum\Paypal\ProCheckout\Nvp\PaypalProCheckoutGatewayFactory();
$gateways['paypal_pro_checkout'] = $factory->create(array(
    'username' => 'REPLACE IT',
    'password' => 'REPLACE IT',
    'partner' => 'REPLACE IT',
    'vendor' => 'REPLACE IT',
    'sandbox' => true
));
```

## prepare.php

Here you have to modify a `gatewayName` value. Set it to `paypal_pro_checkout`. The rest remain the same as described basic [get it started](https://github.com/Payum/Core/blob/master/Resources/docs/get-it-started.md) documentation.
